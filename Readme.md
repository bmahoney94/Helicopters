This repo primarily holds some homework assignements from a helictopers class I took my senior year.
The course covered a certain amount of history, as well as theory of operation of helicopters.

I implemented up to a Blade Element Momentum Theory solver at one point in time, but never took full credit on the hoemwork assignments.
Eventually, I might try and refurb some of this and get it working better.
